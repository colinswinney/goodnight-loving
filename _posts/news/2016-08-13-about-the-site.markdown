Welcome to our new site!

Why make a web page for a broken up band, you ask?  <!--more-->You could say it's equal parts vanity and nostalgia, though a major part of it is simply that Colin wanted to learn something new (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, and it's pretty cool).

We never had much of a "web presence" when we were together, except of course for our incredible <a href="https://myspace.com/thegoodnightloving/" target="_blank">MySpace</a> page, which somehow looks better now than it ever did while we ran the thing.

Four albums, a few singles, one one-sided, screen printed, twelve inch, and a small batch of videos is a pretty neat feat for a band.  It's a recorded testament to the kind of friendship and cooperative creativity that breeds best in basements and bars.  Even if it's the basement of a funeral home.  

So in the interest of reclaiming our identity back from MySpace, we wished to create our own page, collecting the various available online artifacts into one comprehensive history.  We hope you enjoy.
